# Example: add this frontend service to your droplet's ~/housing-platform/docker-compose.yml
# so the app is reachable on the server's port 80 (or another port).

services:
  frontend:
    image: habtamuwgs/housing-platform-frontend:latest
    container_name: housing-platform-frontend
    ports:
      - "80:80"   # Host port 80 → container port 80 (nginx)
    restart: unless-stopped

# If port 80 is already used (e.g. by another app), use another host port, e.g.:
#   ports:
#     - "3000:80"
# Then access the app at http://<droplet-ip>:3000
